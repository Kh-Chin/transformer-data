Do you thrive in driving change? Are you looking for a job that will continue to offer you new, exciting and very visible projects to work on? Would you like the opportunity to help mold a new global team from scratch? If so, read on…

Overview

Citi is one of the world’s leading global banks serving 90% of the Fortune 500 companies. Our global network spans 97 markets serving clients in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. We provide a broad range of financial services and products to our clients to help them meet their biggest opportunities and face the world’s toughest challenges. This specific role sits within our Client On-Boarding Team which is part of our Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) function within our Institutional Client Group (ICG).

This specific job positing is exciting, it’s an opportunity to come in and be part of a brand new global team that hasn’t existed before at Citi. We are looking to build a team of highly versatile talented individuals across the globe that can help Citi and our clients manage change. These could be regulatory / market-based changes which have a direct impact on how clients initiate payments with us (e.g. impact of Brexit or SWIFT moving from MT to MX (PACS) messaging) or it could be that Citi ourselves are trying to retire legacy technology and products and move clients to new technology and newer products. Whether it is regulatory driven or Citi driven, where there is a client impact, we want to build a team specifically to assist clients through whatever the related client migration activity might be.

What Will You Do?

This is an individual contributor role that will report directly to the Global Head of Client Migration Projects. Your main responsibilities will consist of:

Playing a leading role in your region (EMEA / APAC / NAM / LATAM) for executing any Client Migration Programs that are Global in nature. There may also be opportunities for cross-regional engagement depending on the projects that are running.
Where a Client Migration Program is unique to your region, you will take the lead in partnering with your regional Product and Technology peers to understand the pipeline of client migration programs, understanding specifically what our clients are going to need to do, by what deadline and specifically what we need to do to support the migration.
Build effective plans for each client migration program to cover client communications, engagement, client DEV / SIT / UAT / QC testing windows, tracking & reporting progress, tracking issues & defects, resource planning, etc.
Create process documentation to clearly articulate the execution requirements for our teams to follow internally for each individual client migration piece of work.
To support your Client Migration Programs, we will have an outsourced vendor team that you will be able to tap in to for regional resourcing requirements as necessary. Where assigned to you for your Client Migration Program, you will provide the oversight and guidance of the vendor-based team to support the required client migration execution work.
Provide regular reporting and updates to senior management and internal partners on all in-flight client migration programs.

Who Are We Looking For?

We are conscious that we are building out this role and team for the first time, so we are open minded and would like to have people apply from a diverse range of backgrounds. There are however some key attributes which we think would give you the best foundation to becoming successful in this role:

Great communicator – must be comfortable speaking with people of varying levels of seniority and technical knowledge both internally and externally (this will be a client facing team after all!)
Technical acumen – you don’t need to be from a technology background but you need to be able to be comfortable diving into technical discussions, understanding technical documentation, solving technical problems
Adaptability and a fast learner – Client migrations programs will span different products and different jurisdictions, so there will always be new things to learn as no one client migration program will likely ever be the same
Program / Project management – Experience in governing large pieces of work – planning & execution
Process Driven – Can build & document processes from scratch and constantly evolve them to improve our client migration framework
Bonus points if you have any of these skills / experiences: System integration – getting systems speaking to each other, XML – a familiarity with the message formats especially in the payments domain, general knowledge of treasury and cash management (payments, receivables, digital banking, corporate cards, trade finance).
Types of jobs you may have done previously that make you a good candidate (but not limited to): Project / Program Manager, Business Analyst, Technical Consultant.

What's In It For You?

You will touch a wide range of products and get to interface with a great network of talented individuals across multiple functions (Product, Sales, Technology, and Operations) and geographies (we are present in over 90 countries!) – so this is a role that can open a lot of doors in terms of onwards career opportunities. We are big believers in mobility and pushing people forwards in their careers.

We also provide a lot of flexibility – there is no ‘clock-in’, ‘clock-out’ we let people manage their work around their lives and currently have a hybrid approach to office presence (3 days in the office, 2 days where you like). Other key benefits include:

Live Well, Stay Healthy – Citi provide programs and services for your physical and mental well-being, including private healthcare.
Paid Parental Leave – We believe all parents deserve time to adjust to parenthood and bond with the newest members of their families.
Save Well, For Now and Your Future – We empower our employees to manage their financial well-being and help them plan for the future with our pension scheme.
Keep Learning – Citi provides access to an array of learning and development resources to help broaden and deepen your skills and knowledge.
Be Well, Take Time Off – We have a variety of programs that help employees balance their work and life, including generous paid time off packages.
Support Your Community – We offer our employees resources and tools to volunteer in the communicates in which they live and work.

So now that you have read a bit about Citi, the role, what we are looking for and the benefits you will get – if it still sounds good click to apply today! We look forward to hearing from you.
