You will have international and cross-functional career prospects, with excellent opportunities to develop yourself to higher positions within the organization where everyone is duly rewarded by performance.

Click through the 'Apply Now' button where you will be asked to upload your CV and answer a couple of short questions – the whole process should take around 90 seconds. If we like what we see, you'll be invited to a telephone interview.

Who is Hilti?

We provide leading-edge tools, technologies, software and services for the global construction sector. Hilti is a multicultural workplace with 55 different nationalities committed to global teamwork.

Global IT within Hilti is a truly global team with main hubs in Buchs (Switzerland), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) and Plano/Tulsa (USA).

Expertise in at least one of the areas of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), SAP ERP, SAP MM, Product Information Management (PIM), CAD systems, BIM, or a related field
You have general coding knowledge in ABAP, XML, SQL, Java/JavaScript or any other programming language
An end-to-end process understanding in the field of product engineering and/or product data management
Willingness to learn
Courage to challenge and desire to improve things
Great communication skills (English is a must)
Experience as a Business Analyst in a PLM or MDM environment is a plus

Why should you apply?

Become a valuable member of our highly professional and international team of IT experts and tackle the challenges of a global multinational company using the latest technologies. You will have the freedom to act in the responsible area and will have career prospects in a dynamic environment with excellent opportunities to develop yourself to higher levels and wider range of knowledge. We have a clearly defined career development track for every individual employee and an excellent team who are duly rewarded by performance.

Interested for the role?

Click through the 'Apply Now' button where you will be asked to upload your CV and answer a couple of short questions–the whole process should take around 90 seconds. If we like what we see, you'll be invited to a telephone interview.

If we don't have a suitable role for you at the moment, we will keep you in our talent pool for the future so your recruitment process might take a bit longer but we'll be sure to stay in touch.
