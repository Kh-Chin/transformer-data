It is a true icon brand that every Australian knows and loves.

Almost 2 million Australians search its classifieds every month, using online, mobile or tablet.

Trading Post today is growing fast, runs a 24/7 operation and its highly capable development team uses the latest technology and platforms to deliver cutting edge tools for its products, brands and the classifieds market.

The Trading Post company culture is important to us. Our culture successfully matches strong family values and loyalty with a high performance environment, which makes it a great place to contribute, achieve and learn.

The company is always looking for bright, new staff who thrive in a dynamic international environment.

Responsibilities:

A rare opportunity exists for a young but experienced C# full stack DevOps engineer and software architect with leadership aspirations to build our new international software development team from scratch.
Reporting to the country manager, this exciting role will begin with you becoming familiar with our current tech stack and architecture by working on some of our existing development pipeline with technical guidance from our incumbent overseas based CTO.
You will then begin building your new team of highly motivated and results oriented coding gurus to fulfill the technology needs of our recent exciting business growth.
At this point you will become responsible for the entire solution stack from environment & networking (mainly AWS) right through to front end UX and everything in-between.
We're looking for raw talent & excitement in this role - no uni degree needed. What we do require is an intelligent, dedicated, eager to learn programmer with a real passion for coding and a roll-your-sleeves-up attitude that continues even after they are in a leadership position.
We're primarily a C#/.Net shop, but we do have projects in other languages as well. We work a lot with MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis, and SQL.
We work with huge amounts of data and serve 100's of millions of requests each month.
We strongly believe in using the best tool for job - even if that means learning something new, and we are obsessive about code efficiency, stability and performance.

You may need to undertake an IQ test and personality profiling.
You might be given some theory tests that require a working knowledge of C#/Net to pass.
You might be given a practical test which involves you creating a simple application using C# and Visual Studio.
You might need to analyze, debug and comment some code that we supply, using Visual Studio.
In terms of environment, platforms, database, and language proficiency, we currently have the following in our stack. You will also need to be willing & eager to constantly learn as technologies change and better options become available.

Prior successful experience in designing, building, and operating extremely high traffic web solutions/apps and a strong familiarity with the techniques required to handle these large loads while delivering a snappy and pleasant user experience would be a huge advantage.
You need strong research and self-learning skills.
You need to be the type of person that takes responsibility and ownership for the tasks they are given
You need to have the determination and grit to finish jobs - not just start them.
You need to be honest, forthright, willing to admit mistakes, and ready to ask for help when you need it.
