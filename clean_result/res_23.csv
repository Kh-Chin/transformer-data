This exciting role will act as an accelerator for the Business Unit’s agile journey. You are a change agent with a passion for coaching and empowering teams to transform their behaviors.

Background & Purpose

To win in today’s environment and grow our business, we need to set up for success to behave with agility. Agility starts with the right mindset, which is grounded in core values and principles – you do not “do” agile; you “are” agile.

Ultimately, this drives growth by being able to move faster (speed), with a more engaged workforce, that is closer to the consumer. All of this is underpinned by the key ingredient of psychological safety and welcoming a learn-fast mentality, where an equal voice is encouraged.

The outcome-based goals and end-to-end autonomy in the new Compass organization are agility come to life – Agile will be the “how” of the new Compass organization. It is built upon the proven theory that organizations can increase their value delivery in a VUCA world, not by asking teams to work harder or longer, but by being ruthlessly prioritized, focused, and highly disciplined in how we work. These agile coach roles will be accelerators for Business Units (BU) and leaders to turbocharge their agile journey – exciting opportunities to make an impact in the organization!

The Supply Planner role is responsible for devising a production plan and managing the execution of the plan in order to support business needs. A Supply Planner acts as a key connector between Demand Planning and Manufacturing. It is the responsibility of the Planner to understand the business and to build a responsive network that can react to the volatility of the market while managing inventory levels, non-finished good material availability, and waste implications.

As part of the Supply Planning Team, you will need to drive initiatives to meet team goals, ensure the continuous improvement of processes and outcomes, optimize the delivery of service, inventory and production planning and work collaboratively on new product development plans. Frequent and effective interaction with demand planning, factories, suppliers, procurement and logistics teams is essential.

In addition, you will prepare capacity-constrained supply plans using planning tools; organize and coordinate meetings with 3PMs to build a “partner to win” relationship and identify future customer service risks and work with the cross-functional teams to quantify and reduce the impact on customers.

Who You Are & What You’ll Do

The Supply Planner is expected to be a team player. The Supply Planner will understand big picture ideas and work to incorporate company-wide goals and values into our Supply Chain.

{company} Future Leaders Programme (UFLP) Supply Chain - {location}

The {company} Future Leaders Programme is about developing tomorrow’s leaders, today.

The Programme encompasses rotations within and across functions in an accelerated learning environment. This includes international stints, extended leadership contact, formal training, and professional development.

What Will You Be Doing?

How do you get 12,000 litres of ice cream across the desert without it melting? How do you transform the world’s largest spreads factory or bring an innovative new product to life? What will you do? Getting a delicious ice cream like Magnum into the hands of a customer in the right condition at the right time and price takes serious business expertise.

At {company}, there are 3 areas of Supply Chain – Supply Management, Manufacturing and Logistics – which call for clear thinkers with good strategic, logistical skills. Over at least three placements, you’ll get an inside look at several production sites and head office operations, which may include projects within supply management, logistics, planning and a factory team leadership role.

Supply Chain at {company}: From sourcing raw materials to get a great product and delivering the end products to supermarket shelves, our supply chain is at the heart of getting brands to customers.

Customer Service – Logistics: This area is responsible for solving challenges such as on-shelf availability. Roles include order management, working at the interface between warehousing and transportation, and ensuring products arrive as promised to meet customer needs.

Customer Service – Planning: Demand planning uses models as well as market knowledge to determine potential sales. Using this data, supply planning ensures factories are able to meet these sales demands on time and in the most cost-effective way possible. By integrating the demand and supply planning, the team captures and evaluates new developments in planning capabilities and strategies where relevant to drive continuous improvement.

Procurement: This is about optimizing the cost and quality of what we buy through the intelligent sourcing of materials, packaging and non-production items. The team explores new ways of working with suppliers and plays an important role in technology innovation and driving sustainability through procurement.

The {company} culture is varied, and friendly and encourages innovative thinking. We will push and support you to achieve your potential, giving you the chance to shape your career path according to your own interests, strengths and ambitions.

<strong>Unilever Future Leaders Programme (UFLP) Supply Chain - Malaysia<br>

<br>
The Programme encompasses rotations within and across functions in an accelerated learning environment. This includes international stints, extended leadership contact, formal training, and professional development.<br>
<br>
<strong>What Will You Be Doing?<br>
<br>
</strong>How do you get 12,000 litres of ice cream across the desert without it melting? How do you transform the world’s largest spreads factory or bring an innovative new product to life? What will you do? Getting a delicious ice cream like Magnum into the hands of a customer in the right condition at the right time and price takes serious business expertise.<br>
<br>
At Unilever, there are 3 areas of Supply Chain – <strong>Supply Management, Manufacturing and Logistics</strong> – which call for clear thinkers with good strategic, logistical skills. Over at least three placements, you’ll get an inside look at several production sites and head office operations, which may include projects within supply management, logistics, planning and a factory team leadership role.<br>
<br>
<strong>Supply Chain at Unilever</strong>: From sourcing raw materials to get a great product and delivering the end products to supermarket shelves, our supply chain is at the heart of getting brands to customers.<br>
<br>
<strong>Customer Service – Logistics:</strong> This area is responsible for solving challenges such as on-shelf availability. Roles include order management, working at the interface between warehousing and transportation, and ensuring products arrive as promised to meet customer needs.<br>
<br>
<strong>Customer Service – Planning</strong>: Demand planning uses models as well as market knowledge to determine potential sales. Using this data, supply planning ensures factories are able to meet these sales demands on time and in the most cost-effective way possible. By integrating the demand and supply planning, the team captures and evaluates new developments in planning capabilities and strategies where relevant to drive continuous improvement.<br>
<br>
<strong>Procurement:</strong> This is about optimizing the cost and quality of what we buy through the intelligent sourcing of materials, packaging and non-production items. The team explores new ways of working with suppliers and plays an important role in technology innovation and driving sustainability through procurement.<br>
<br>

Key metrics:
Satisfaction scores from the sites
Go4Zero maturity score per site
Contribution to Productivity
Effectiveness of 5S, RCA and Team boards and future CI tools
Nr of validated A&P SME standards & deliverables

Education, Qualifications & Experience:

You are a role model when it comes to CI culture and Gemba centricity
You have experience working in a multinational business context
Continuous improvement experience in a process or semi-process industry (>5y) with a strong experience in lean thinking
Lean six sigma black belt level or comparable in terms of knowledge and expertise
Good communicator, and network builder both with the sites, global and other supporting functions
Shop floor-oriented, hence regular on-site presence will be key, rotating between regions and sites, you should be willing to travel up to 50% of the time.
You have experience in coaching people on how to manage change when supporting complex and innovative projects
You are a strong leader in cultural change and operational transformation and master the ability to make this vision to all layers of the organization

You are a strong communicator, able to interact with various stakeholders, often with different business objectives and operating at different levels in the organization (global, regional, local).
You create a culture of collaboration and achieving results together
You have strong organizational skills, setting up and managing multiple projects in parallel.

You have experience with process control and engineering, quality tools like, gage R&R, SPC, capability indexes, DOE and asset maintenance processes and have the ability to coach the people on the application of these.
You have the strong ability to effectively manage the change during transformations, create a CI mindset and coach factory teams on how to collectively embrace and sustain a high level of CI culture, assuring the Go4Zero ambition and targets linked to it.

At Barry Callebaut, we are committed to Diversity & Inclusion. United by our strong values, we thrive on the diversity of who we are, where we come from, what we’ve experienced and how we think.
