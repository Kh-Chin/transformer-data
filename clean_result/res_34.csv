This exciting role will act as an accelerator for the Business Unit’s agile journey. You are a change agent with a passion for coaching and empowering teams to transform their behaviors.

Music shapes the core of our mission to create memorable experiences for our guests, staff, and partners. To cater to a broader audience, each venue features a specific genre: from pop and retro to jazz and house music.

On the F&B front, we offer an eclectic menu of creative Asian and Western cuisines paired with signature cocktails and an extensive drinks list. Our close-knit, warm and professional team is committed to providing best-in-class services and setting the bar for guest experiences.

Our story

The Tin Box brand story began in 2018. Founder Adrian Leong channeled his passion for vinyl and turntables into a space for guests to gather and connect over good music, food, and drinks. Tucked in Mohamed Sultan Road, Tin Box Retroholics was a vinyl-based club that conjured up the 80s club scene with resident DJs and retro music. Before long, Retroholics became a regular hangout for retro music and vinyl lovers and built a loyal fan base.

In 2020, Retroholics was renamed Simply Retro by Tin Box and moved to its current location at CHIJMES.

The name ‘Tin Box’

In the 60s and 70s, old provision shops used empty Milo or Milkmaid tin cans

as cash ‘box’ that was hung from the ceiling with a simple pulley system. If the shopkeeper was busy and out of sight, a customer would grab what he needed and drop cash into the can, based on a trust system.

The name Tin Box takes inspiration from this community spirit. We take pride in nurturing relationships with our guests, suppliers, teams, and partners based on honor and a sense of togetherness.

The Tin Box story continues as we expand, continue to innovate, and redefine music and dining experiences both locally and internationally.
