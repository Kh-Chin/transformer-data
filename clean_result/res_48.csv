What does the role involve?

In close collaboration with different cross-functional teams, you define the end-to-end integrations in the Marketing and Sales middleware, interfacing various systems (SAP, Salesforce Sales Cloud, enterprise data lake, web site, etc.) to get insights about customer behaviour and trigger appropriate marketing actions through Hilti’s omni-channel platform. You understand stakeholders’ needs, as opposed to wants, and clearly explain risks and trade-offs of possible solutions. It is your responsibility to evaluate, design and review solutions in Salesforce Marketing Cloud, ensuring compliance with security and architecture standards. Together with other architects, you guard the integrity of the architecture by finding the right balance between innovation, technical feasibility, long-term sustainability, and agile delivery, without compromising quality, security and reliability.

We have a very thorough people review process, unlike any we know of in any other business. We screen everyone in the company in a yearly career performance matching process. It means we can pair talent with opportunities - developing our people in their current roles or challenging them to work in new ways or in new places. It’s how we find the right fit and further our teams personally and professionally.

Additionally, we offer you a competitive salary and a wide range of benefits.

Strong analytical skills, structured approach to problem solving, and desire to continuously explore new technologies
Ability to adaptively communicate with developers, other architects, management as well as business stakeholders
Fluency in English (written and spoken)

Why should you apply?

Become a valuable member of our highly professional and international team of IT experts and tackle the challenges of a global multinational company using the latest technologies. You will have international and cross-functional career prospects, with excellent opportunities to develop yourself to higher positions within the organization where everyone is duly rewarded by performance.

Click through the 'Apply Now' button where you will be asked to upload your CV and answer a couple of short questions – the whole process should take around 90 seconds. If we like what we see, you'll be invited to a telephone interview.

If we don't have a suitable role for you at the moment, we will keep you in our talent pool for the future so your recruitment process might take a bit longer, but we'll be sure to stay in touch.

We are looking for a passionate, creative, and experienced Senior Cloud DevOps Engineer or Senior Cloud Platform Engineer willing to lay down the foundation of our Cloud Development Teams’ future way of working. If you are willing to pick up the challenge, you will be responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the pipelines for our infrastructure-as-code, as well as actively contributing to keep our systems up to date by planning and executing regular improvements and patches. As expert in cloud microservices deployment, maintenance, and monitoring, you will support our teams in bringing the quality of our integration software and microservices to the next level, so that we can enable our consumers to scale seamlessly and tackle any future challenge.

Who is Hilti?

We provide leading-edge tools, technologies, software and services for the global construction sector. Hilti is a multicultural workplace with 55 different nationalities committed to global teamwork.

Global IT within Hilti is a truly global team with main hubs in Buchs (Switzerland), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) and Plano/Tulsa (USA). All locations have highly competent teams who work very closely together. Hilti`s Global IT team is known for their focus on sustainable value creation by translating latest IT innovations into value creating solutions & services.

What does the role involve?

As a DevOps expert, your daily job will focus on building application platforms based on cloud technologies and infrastructure as code, with the assurance of security, reliability, cost effectiveness and operation excellence is considered.

As you will have touch base with the cross-team engineers and developers, then excellent communication skill, collaborative skills, problem solving and creating quality products are essential. You will have the chance to evaluate IT solutions and alternatives for economic and operational feasibility and contribute to the sustainability of our business by ensuring that we use what we need and decommission what we don’t.

We have an excellent mix of people, which we believe makes for a more vibrant, more innovative and more productive team.

What do we offer?

Show us what you’re made of and we’ll offer you opportunities to move around the business – to work abroad, experience different job functions and tackle different markets. It’s a great way to find the right match for your ambitions and achieve the exciting career you’re after.

We have a very thorough people review process, unlike any we know of in any other business. We can pair talent with opportunities - developing our people in their current roles or challenging them to work in new ways or in new places. It’s how we find the right fit, further our teams personally and professionally, get the best value for each employee and increase the job satisfaction. Additionally, we offer you a wide range of benefits.

Understanding of Cloud microservices and event driven design
Experience working in SCRUM or other Agile implementations
