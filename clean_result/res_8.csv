153|Software Architect, Trilogy (Remote) - $200,000/year USD|Crossover|Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia|Full-time|Director|1,001-5,000 employees|IT Services and IT Consulting|Commercial Software, Software, Software Architecture, Software Development|"{company} is the world's  source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

“Coding competitions are for university students” - Wrong.

“Competitive programming is a sport for your free time. Building a software development career is something completely different” - Incorrect.

“Software developers work in Agile teams. You need to collaborate and participate in daily project and team meetings.” - Not when you are with us.

Trilogy uses cloud-native technologies to improve software products for dozens of customers, and we are looking for veteran competitive programmers to help us. We have reinvented the software development process to break down product specs and milestones into individual code challenges with 4-8 hour SLAs, and your job is to crack the problem and beat the clock. It’s no different from a coding competition - except for the US$200k salary and the chance to double your compensation as you move up the Engineering ladder.

The future of work started long ago with us. Home office twice a week? We have been working from wherever we want for the last fifteen years in our 100% remote model. While scrum rituals and daily standups are still dominating the rest of the industry, our team is already operating under a global asynchronous model where each developer follows 8-hour shifts three or four days a week, plans the rest of their workweek flexibly, and never exceeds 40 hours. The development operates 24x7, but you are free to choose your own schedule!

What You Will Be Doing

Designing innovative commercial software and writing high-quality code to bring them into production.
Implementing new features on existing software products by solving complex implementation problems and making the appropriate technical decisions.
Fixing bugs to permanently eliminate defects that impair product functionality.

What You Won’t Be Doing

Dealing with unclear expectations or non-technical managers. Every task will have a clear scope and objective for you to implement.
Executing repeated tasks for the same product using the same tech stack. Our portfolio of 60+ products ensures you are always tackling new challenges.
Non-technical tasks. This is a role for those who love coding and want to dedicate time to solving complex technical issues.

Software Architect Key Responsibilities

Solve the most difficult coding challenges and develop great software products that delight millions of customers.

Education, Qualifications & Experience:

5+ years of commercial software development experience
Availability to work during US business hours

457|Customer Solutions Engineer|Plume Design, Inc|APAC|Full-time|Mid-Senior level|501-1,000 employees|Consumer Services||"Life at Plume

At Plume, we believe that technology isn't about moving faster, it's about making life’s moments better. Which is why we’ve built the world's first, and only, open and hardware-independent service delivery platform for smart homes, small businesses, enterprises, and beyond. Our SaaS platform uses WiFi, advanced AI, and machine learning to create the future of connected spaces—and human experiences—at massive scale.

We now deliver services to over 40 million locations globally and have managed over 2 billion devices on our platform. We’re expanding rapidly, pioneering a new category, and we achieved our Series F funding in just four years. Our customers include many of the world's largest Communications Service Providers (CSPs) who look to Plume to help them evolve their smart home offerings while gleaning insights from their own data.

With a bias for action and a love for being trailblazers, the team at Plume embodies a combination of relentless curiosity and imaginative innovation. We challenge ourselves to think in ways that other companies don't, work to do what should be done (rather than what can), and if we can’t do it exceptionally well, we don’t do it. It’s how we've assembled a team of world-class builders, thinkers, and doers. And it’s how we’re reinventing what’s possible every day.

Understand business requirements involved with technical account strategy
Research and stay up to date on the most recent industry standards and trends, emerging technology in network and server engineering, and have fundamental understanding of the principles of networking and cloud architectures
Hire, develop, and lead an inclusive, engaged, and high performing {job}ing team within an assigned region/market
Provide ongoing interpersonal and technical coaching to {job}s on team

Qualification Requirements
Minimum 3+ years of leadership experience

Hands on experience in configuration of software and hardware including systems, cloud services and networking equipment
Experience working with large entities deploying large scale SaaS networks to millions of end points
Track record of developing and maintaining communications in a cooperative and professional manner with all levels of staff and customers

About Plume
As the creator of the only open, hardware-independent, cloud-controlled experience platform for CSPs and their subscribers, Plume partners with over 250 CSP customers, including some of the world’s largest such as Comcast, Charter, Liberty Global, and J:COM.

Using OpenSync, the most widely supported open-source, silicon-to-cloud framework for smart spaces, Plume’s software-defined network allows CSPs to decouple their service offerings from hardware and rapidly curate and deliver new services over a multi-vendor, open-platform architecture.

Backed by investors such as Insight Partners and SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Plume is now valued at $2.6B, having added over $500M in funding in 2021 alone.
