72|Business Analyst, Forward Kitchens (Remote) - $60,000/year USD|Crossover|Taman Pulau Pinang, Penang, Malaysia|Full-time|Associate|1,001-5,000 employees|IT Services and IT Consulting|Business Analysis, Compensation, Consulting, Food Delivery, Operations|"{company} is the world's  source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Forward Kitchens. Have you got what it takes?

On-demand food delivery is the future of restaurants. However, most restaurants are either ill-equipped or unaware of how to unlock their full delivery revenue potential through digitization. A restaurant’s digital presence could be the difference between a viral hit like Salt Bae’s booming global steak empire (which is just ok, if you ask us) and your favorite mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall that went out of business during the pandemic.

That’s where Forward Kitchens comes in. We empower restaurants to create multiple digital storefronts each, generate more online sales, and increase their bottom line – all without having to hire a creative marketing team or deal with the millions (we’re exaggerating) of delivery platforms out there. We believe in our partner restaurants’ power to represent their communities and provide delicious, eclectic meals to their ever-ravenous customers at scale.

We have a team of around 50 people in the Philippines that is growing rapidly, and we are looking for an experienced operations manager to lead it. In this role, you will monitor performance metrics, coach team members, and continuously look for opportunities to improve our internal processes. You will be held responsible for the performance of the entire Philippines organization and report directly to our executive team. This is an opportunity to have significant influence on the operations of a rapidly scaling tech startup and eventually grow into a more senior role.

What You Will Be Doing

Monitoring and helping build systems that measure operational performance
Managing team performance and holding teams accountable for their results
Building and improving scalable processes and systems

What You Won’t Be Doing

Building dashboards from scratch
Personally servicing customer accounts and support requests

Education, Qualifications & Experience:

Business Analyst key responsibilities

At least 3 years of experience in a senior operations role
Excellent verbal and written communication skills in English
The ability to work US hours (Eastern Standard Time)
Currently based in {location}PAC

169|Strategic Planning Analyst, Forward Kitchens (Remote) - $60,000/year USD|Crossover|Taman Pulau Pinang, Penang, Malaysia|Full-time|Associate|1,001-5,000 employees|IT Services and IT Consulting|APAC, Compensation, Food Delivery, Operations, Strategic Planning|"{company} is the world's  source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Forward Kitchens. Have you got what it takes?

On-demand food delivery is the future of restaurants. However, most restaurants are either ill-equipped or unaware of how to unlock their full delivery revenue potential through digitization. A restaurant’s digital presence could be the difference between a viral hit like Salt Bae’s booming global steak empire (which is just ok, if you ask us) and your favorite mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall that went out of business during the pandemic.

That’s where Forward Kitchens comes in. We empower restaurants to create multiple digital storefronts each, generate more online sales, and increase their bottom line – all without having to hire a creative marketing team or deal with the millions (we’re exaggerating) of delivery platforms out there. We believe in our partner restaurants’ power to represent their communities and provide delicious, eclectic meals to their ever-ravenous customers at scale.

We have a team of around 50 people in the Philippines that is growing rapidly, and we are looking for an experienced operations manager to lead it. In this role, you will monitor performance metrics, coach team members, and continuously look for opportunities to improve our internal processes. You will be held responsible for the performance of the entire Philippines organization and report directly to our executive team.

                Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Forward Kitchens. Have you got what it takes?<p><br>
</p>On-demand food delivery is the future of restaurants. However, most restaurants are either ill-equipped or unaware of how to unlock their full delivery revenue potential through digitization. A restaurant’s digital presence could be the difference between a viral hit like Salt Bae’s booming global steak empire (which is just ok, if you ask us) and your favorite mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall that went out of business during the pandemic.<p><br>
</p>That’s where Forward Kitchens comes in. We empower restaurants to create multiple digital storefronts each, generate more online sales, and increase their bottom line – all without having to hire a creative marketing team or deal with the millions (we’re exaggerating) of delivery platforms out there. We believe in our partner restaurants’ power to represent their communities and provide delicious, eclectic meals to their ever-ravenous customers at scale.<p><br>
</p>We have a team of around 50 people in the Philippines that is growing rapidly, and we are looking for an experienced operations manager to lead it. In this role, you will monitor performance metrics, coach team members, and continuously look for opportunities to improve our internal processes. You will be held responsible for the performance of the entire Philippines organization and report directly to our executive team.

Enabled by a streamlined organizational structure and automated management activities, you will build an efficient team and deliver business value to thousands of customers while working 40h a week from the comfort of your own home office.

High-level strategies without implementation guidelines. Your recommendations must be based on product-level insights.

Vice President Of Software Engineering Key Responsibilities

Create a fully-functional, scalable development model capable of transforming hundreds of software products using a full-cloud approach.

Education, Qualifications & Experience:

5+ years of experience with coding or architectural design.

This role is a unique opportunity to have an impact on {company}’s mission in helping our customers have a great experience when using {company}.

Your mission:

{company} has already pioneered new ways for people to transfer money across borders and currencies. Our customers can also manage their hard-earned money with the world’s first platform to offer true multi-currency banking. Your mission is to help customers have the best experience possible with our product working across email, phone and chat.

Help customers have the best experience possible with our product working across email, phone and chat
Be flexible working during business hours but sometimes covering an early morning(from 4am), evening (from 10pm) or weekend shift
Go above and beyond the call of duty: work with less supervision and solve complex problems working with other teams while still achieving your KPIs
Grow through mentoring and side projects with other teams, developing your skills and figuring out how to have a big impact on our customers
Work autonomously – at {company} you get in what you put out so you’ll need to take the initiative when it comes to your career progression

Education, Qualifications & Experience:

You:
Hold a Malaysian Citizenship or Permanent Residency (please note we cannot support Visas for this role)
Have excellent verbal and written English and Bahasa Indonesia.
Are flexible. While you’ll set your own schedule, the requirements can change based on our customers needs, so we can’t guarantee you your preferred shift and shifts can change over time
Have a razor sharp attention to detail. Can multitask and take responsibility in challenging, high pressure situations.
You hustle. And hard.
You’ll ideally have worked in customer support before, but don’t worry if you haven’t. We’re willing to work with the right person as long as they’re passionate and always striving to give a great customer experience.

How we work:

We work differently and we’re proud of it. As part of our support team, you’ll play a key role in helping our customers have a great experience with {company}.

You’ll also be the link between our customers and teams, helping our product teams identify areas for improvement.

There’s no script and no hand holding and we trust each other to get stuff done.
