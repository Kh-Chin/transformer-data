55|Group Compensation & Benefits Lead|Frazer Jones|Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia|Full-time|Director|51-200 employees|Staffing and Recruiting|Compensation & Benefits, Compensation Management, Compensation Planning, Compensation Strategies, Compensation Structures, Employee Benefits, Employee Rewards Programs, Global Compensation, Incentive Programs, Total Rewards Strategies|"We are pleased to be partnering an Asian-headquartered enterprise operating in the Consumer Appliances space to appoint a Compensation & Benefits Lead that sits at the Group level (circa. MYR$500,000 per annum). The client is guided by the meaningful principles of self-actualisation and empowerment, which are weaved into the wide range of consumer products that they offer. Such ideologies are not only targeted externally (i.e. paying customers), but also make up a key cornerstone of the client’s Human Resources blueprint. It is therefore of little surprise that they are looking for a visionary who possesses the tenacity to deliver a revised Total Rewards strategy on their path towards achieving greater organizational excellence. This is a newly created role based in {location}alaysia.

Reporting into the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), the successful individual will be laying down Compensation & Benefits agenda at the Group level with three key deliverables. First, s/he has to ensure continuity across the 10 brands while allowing for individual tailorisations. This includes crafting a unified Rewards philosophy, benchmarking against market and brands, job architecture (re)design, salary ranging among other constituent parts that will make up a comprehensive framework. Second, s/he will extend such standardizations to the geographic levels, as each of the three major regions (APAC, Americas and Europe) are currently operating on a decentralized basis. Hence, it is imperative to iron out any outstanding discrepancies (especially on benefits entitlements) while enabling idiosyncrasies at the country and regional scales to be upheld. Finally, s/he is responsible for devising long-term incentive plans (e.g. RSU/ESOP) that will attract and retain employees at the c-suite levels and below. Other projects that the incoming will have to undertake include being the point person for all Merger & Acquisition (M&A) activities from a Rewards perspective. In essence, this role is highly strategic and client-facing role that spans varying scales, but also requires him/her to stay grounded and ensure the proposed strategies are sustainable in the long-term.

We are looking for a proven Total Rewards professional who not only has experience setting up Rewards frameworks (both broad-based and executive in nature), but also a proven track record of bringing said frameworks to maturity. A blend of consultancy and inhouse backgrounds will henceforth be looked upon favourably. Experience driving Rewards strategies across a portfolio of brands, crosscutting the Group/global, regional and country levels, are likewise highly preferred. Aside from staying current on best practices within the Rewards space, you should possess the gravitas necessary for engaging stakeholders within and beyond Human Resources, including pushing back and standing firm on justified recommendations at appropriate junctures.

Thanks for your time. Please apply to find out more about this role or reach out to Janard LIEW at {email} for a confidential discussion.

Successful Referrals are rewarded – so share their details with us!

<strong><u>Who You Are &amp; What You’ll Do<br>
<br>
</u></strong>The Supply Planner is expected to be a team player. The Supply Planner will understand big picture ideas and work to incorporate company-wide goals and values into our Supply Chain. The ideal candidate is comfortable balancing a number of responsibilities at once and can pivot between projects with ease.
