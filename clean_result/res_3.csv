But 'Digital Transformation' is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

224|Material Planning Manager: Silicon One|Cisco|Penang, Malaysia|Full-time||10,001+ employees|Software Development|Communication, Business Metrics, Commodities, Gap Analysis, Interpersonal Skills, Next-Generation Network (NGN), Planning Systems, Presentations, Production Planning, Supplier Management|"About us:
We're in a dynamic phase within Supply Chain Operations and are seeking inspiring talent to join our team. We are looking for an inspiring individual to run the material planning for the Silicon One Supply chain group.

You'll be part of our Group driving our next-generation network devices - {company} Silicon One???.

{company} Silicon One??? is a revolutionary, ground-breaking technology for our customers and end-users for decades to come! The Internet now has a new faster, better, safer engine!

The team is passionate about outstanding customer experience be it internal or external partners. As part of this dynamic team, we work with cross-functional teams to be responsible for the supply chain for Silicon One

Responsibilities:
In this role, you'll:
Responsible for creating material plans for Silicon Commodities based on demand forecasts on a periodic basis
Work closely with suppliers and foundry partners to ensure vendor capacity compliance
Release material plans to suppliers on a monthly basis for long-term planning and capacity allocation
Run supply-demand gap analysis with the suppliers based on commitment received from the suppliers
Update supplier commits by participating in and supporting monthly SIOP activities
Expedite and manage supplier allocations based on business needs
Identify and communicate supply chain disruptions to internal cross-functional groups as needed and work toward a resolution

About us:
Product Supply Planning & Fulfillment, Material & Capacity Planning, Global Inventory Management & Manufacturing Logistics Operations along with extended partners (e.g. Global Supplier Management)
You'll partner with Supply Chain eco-system partners to optimize the Si supply chain and operations to meet key business metrics.

Education, Qualifications & Experience:
You have excellent presentation and interpersonal skills including written, verbal, and listening skills.
End-to-end supply planning (including co-planning with suppliers) for the related silicon products.
Excellent knowledge of demand & supply planning, manufacturing execution, logistics processes, and planning systems.
Deep knowledge of manufacturing processes and procedures, and the semiconductor industry.
You are adept at influencing partner executives and are capable of influencing internal decision-makers to make decisions aligned with strategies and objectives benefiting the entire organization.

About us:
{company}, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're 'old' (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do ' you can't put us in a box!

But 'Digital Transformation' is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"|"<article class=""jobs-description__container
