You set up new projects by responding to briefs and RFPs, leading pitches, treatments, and production proposals.
Together with our creatives, you’ll help to shape these projects into a joint success by leading the production on our behalf.
Responsibilities:
Working at MediaMonks means you get to produce projects that engage with new and innovative uses of technology that require you to lead the way on uncharted paths of production.
As a producer, you are also responsible for scoping and quoting projects in addition to timing, planning & managing production work. You help to establish what gets done, and make sure projects are profitable and doable.

What You’ll Bring

You boast at least 5 years of high-level experience working as a film or video content producer, managing crews to collectively create dope content.
Your portfolio includes food and/or beauty content that shows a real understanding of fluid dynamics and animation. In other words, you know how to make food look mighty tasty.
Your experience in a similar capacity has given you a battle-scarred pokerface immune to stress (the freakouts come out at night, but that’s alright).
Leading the production of multiple campaigns is no easy task and requires someone with superb planning and communication skills, as testified in your insanely good emails and other communiques.
We need a true-born team player who can successfully work across teams, time zones, and technologies.

relationship building and networking with colleagues, clients and the media;

monitoring the media, including newspapers, magazines, journals, broadcasts, newswires, social media sites and blogs, for opportunities for clients;

working as part of an account team to develop client proposals and implement the PR activity;

preparing regular client reports and attending client meetings;

researching, writing and distributing press releases to targeted media;

promoting news stories and features to the media, known as 'selling in';

collating, analysing and evaluating media coverage;

event management, including press conferences and promotional events;

65|Campaign Manager|Ink - we are travel media|Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia|Full-time|Associate|201-500 employees|Media and Telecommunications||"We’re new to market and we’re disrupting a stale sector by bringing our unique technology to the travel industry for the first time ever.

Navigator is a global audience agency which accesses the 1st party data of the biggest airlines and travel booking sites globally. As we grow and learn, we are now expanding the Campaign Management team to ensure our clients are onboarded as efficiently and as accurately as possible. We are part of a wider legacy business which has been around for 27 years and have offices in London, New York, Miami, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur.

Navigator prides itself on its culture which is one based on responsibility rather than hierarchy. We are a combination of diverse backgrounds, collaborating to put forward innovative, creative and strategic solutions to drive the business towards its vision.

We are on a mission
We have identified a big problem in the travel industry – the inability for brands and agencies to know where their customer is, and digitally market to them at the exact moment they would likely purchase their product/service. By having access to a huge amount of 1st travel party data in APAC, we are able to build highly targeted audiences and allow brands to reach their potential customers across Meta, Google and TikTok. We are on a mission to grow and realise the potential of this business and as we scale the volume of clients, we need to ensure that they are onboarded onto our platform as best as we can. We are also a team who collaborate, innovate, make quick decisions, and are unconventional in our thinking.

Here’s where you come in…
We are looking for someone who is process driven, who loves attention to detail and who likes getting things right.
Mastering the current 23 stage process we have and ensuring that we are constantly updating it to become more efficient and accurate
Collaborating with internal teams so that tasks are completed on time as well as managing the client between contract signature and the campaign going live
Communicating effectively and setting clear expectations on what success looks like and the optimal strategy to launch the campaign
Honing your project management skills and making sure no detail is missed
Identifying where we can be better and how our processes and structures can be improved.
Sharing your passion for digital marketing, your skills and learning with others - adding your ambition to that of the agency

Skills can be learnt and taught, who you are at your core cannot. We need someone who:
Has a demonstrable history building and running marketing campaigns (preferably digital) either client side or agency based
Has managed multiple complex projects and deadlines at the same time and delivered on efficiency and accuracy
Is familiar with working across Meta, Google and TikTok platforms
Is a self-starter - unafraid to move from thinking to doing and running the whole campaign process from contract signature to go live
Is able and comfortable to be client facing as well as co ordinate internal teams to deliver projects on time and with the highest quality

Our business is about our people
We know that we are nothing without our people and that they determine the journey we are going on together. We have an environment which facilitates growth and learning through curiosity and a desire to be the best we can. We will support every one of our team in order to help them achieve this and intend to grow the global team of Account Specialists which means there will be no shortage of opportunity.

Ink has been in business for 27 years and is the world’s leading travel media company. We work with the largest travel media brands and airlines worldwide. In 2019 we became part of Stagwell a Nasdaq trading company, founded in 2015, by Mark Penn (x-Microsoft). We have a collective vision as a global marketing and communications group on transforming marketing globally. We say our industry has been dominated for decades by four firms that haven’t evolved fast enough to adapt to the times

What We Offer
Competitive Salary + EPF
Health insurance
Above-market annual leave allowance + all public holidays
World class training and development, with lots of opportunity for growth
Fun, energetic, and productive work environment
A strong and supportive regional team
Coaching and development programs with some of the best coaches on Earth
The opportunity to drive growth on the best platforms in the market to target a travelling consumer
A chance to work some of the biggest travel partners in the region
International travel opportunities"|"<article class=""jobs-description__container

We’re looking for someone to help vet the visual work we produce for industry-leading companies, and establish a standard of quality for our digital zazz.

As one of the pioneer QA Monks to join the team, you’ll play a key role in setting up the global Visual QA process for a multi-year project.
You’ll employ knowledge of manual testing methods to assess and ascertain the correct visual display of advertising assets such as display ads, social content and video.
You ensure that every asset and deliverable looks the way it should on any browser and device.
You’re the last line of defence before our work gets served to the general public, saving your coworkers from potentially embarrassing or damaging mistakes.
Like a broken record (that isn’t broken; or is to be fixed in the next sprint) - you constantly ask: is the design pixel perfect? and does it meet guidelines, specs and other requirements? What if you press the red button?
You help to better integrate visual quality assurance into the overall production process, making sure our production and testing methods are tuned to the project.
You help educate our Monks on best practices with regards to versioning and formatting so that more and more assets look perfect from the get-go, reducing everyone’s workload.
You are a perfectionist machine and no misaligned pixel escapes your gaze.

Education, Qualifications & Experience:

For this QA role, we’re looking for someone who is specialized in visual and manual testing of digital assets.
You have 2 years of relevant QA-testing and/or digital/print design experience.
You’re a proficient English communicator, able to provide clear feedback, and you know how to describe issues and required actions to Monks in other offices.
You understand the effort that goes into creating and delivering assets on a large scale, and you are proficient in detecting the timing and level of involvement needed from QA at each stage.
With a feel for aesthetics and eagle-eye for technical requirements, you’re experienced in making sure every design looks pixel perfect.
You are eager to take the lead and are comfortable with being assigned ownership.
As we’ll produce a ton of assets for this project, we bank on your ability to organise and prioritise your workload to keep on top of your QA game.
In addition to visual QA skills, you have social and professional skills and feel confident in tackling a big global project in tag team with an international team of Monks.
You’re proficient in working with the Adobe Creative Suite, especially Photoshop and Illustrator
You know your way around Ticket Trackers, preferably Jira/Assembla

Nice to Have

Experience working with a creative publishing platform, preferably Google DoubleClick Studio
Experience and proficiency working with Google Workspace and Microsoft Office tools

The perfect candidate doesn’t exist, but you might be just who we’re looking for.

For this senior-level position, we’re looking for an experienced English copywriter who can work at a high, international level with a minimum of 8 years working experience in Copywriting or similiar industry.
You meet the requirements to work in Malaysia.
Your copy is clear and compelling; your work gets consumers eating out of your hand.
You appreciate the good, the bad and the ugly of programmatic advertising and behavioral targeting in order to create effective and engaging copy.
Your storytelling skills allow you to work on scripts that leave an impression in as little as 6 seconds.
Producing quality work out of detailed briefs and thin air alike, you create copy with clever lines and insights we can build brands on.
You have a proven ability to tackle the same topic from a variety of angles and can produce alts for reviews and A/B tests.
Combining creative and critical thinking, your analytical approach means you ask the right questions and make sense of briefs from a strategic and conceptual perspective.
You have a knack for structure and organisation—both in words and in the way you work—collaborating through clear and comprehensive content matrices.
You're comfortable presenting work to clients and can always rationalise your choices, considerations and thought process to win people over with your words
As part of a constructive feedback loop, you can give and handle critique without making it or taking it personally.
You are the change you want to see in the word: you improve what is said, not just how.
Your attention to detail is close to annoying: typos, errors, inconsistencies and questionable punctuation marks have little chance of getting past your cursor.
You’re comfortable jumping in and out at any stage of a project—from first ideas to final words—delivering tight work even under tight deadlines.
Having a great sense of personal responsibility, you're keen to learn and push yourself to make good, great—and just a tad more tasty.
