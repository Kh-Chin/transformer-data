We operate on a fully remote basis, with team members spread throughout the world, across many locations, lifestyles, and backgrounds. It’s our differences that make us special, and our shared belief in our core values that bind us together.

These values form Mailbird's culture as one guided by respect, transparency, collaboration, and direct feedback. We put our customers at the heart of everything we do, and we do so through a diverse team working together in an honest, inclusive environment.
