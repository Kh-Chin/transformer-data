Hello! Welcome to Plaza Premium Group, we're people passionate about ""Making Travel Better"". We are a global company with team members from all walks of life, together we are #PPGFamily, together we are building a legacy.

You don't need to be from this industry, you do need to be passionate.

Our promise to you:
- We will respect and value your background and perspectives
- We will work together with integrity
- We will share our incredible pride for job, company, and industry

What we ask of you:
- Bring passion to all that you do
- Listen, move fast and think innovatively
- Speak up, have ideas, and share them
- Believe in customer service, and treating every person with kindness

As industry leaders in innovating global airport hospitality, you will work with colleagues from all parts of the world for a truly global experience. You will help and craft services and facilities in over 200 locations in more than 60 international airports across the world.

Who we are:
We were established in HK in 1998 by someone who understood the value of an airport lounge and felt that the experience shouldn't just be limited to a closed-circuit group of travelers. Through the years we have worked incredibly hard to create an experience that is both accessible and quality. Almost 25 years later we now span four core business segments: airport lounges, airport terminal hotels, airport meet & greet services, and a range of airport dining concepts.

We deliver our service through a combination of Ten's proprietary, unique technology-enabled platform and the expertise of our highly trained lifestyle managers. Ten is growing quickly and has ambitious plans to keep innovating, inspiring and to continue to improve the lives of millions of members.

Will you help take us there?

The Golden Triangle neighborhood, Kuala Lumpur’s thriving business and financial district, will soon see the opening of the new Four Seasons Hotel and Residences. The Hotel is part of a 65-storey mixed-use tower that will include 242 Four Seasons Private Residences, 27 serviced apartments, a 209-key Four Seasons Hotel and a six- floor of 250,000 square foot luxury retail podium, collectively known as Four Seasons Place Kuala Lumpur.

The latest addition to the city’s dramatic skyline and a vibrant hub for both business and leisure travelers, Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur will be conveniently located in close proximity to the city’s major attractions, including the Petronas Twin Towers and the Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC). Often referred to as a “city within a city,” the KLCC will offer designer shopping, fine dining, and the best of the city’s electric nightlife. The Hotel will also overlook the KLCC Park and be directly connected to the esplanade, allowing guests to take full advantage of the Park’s 50 acres of green space, including lush gardens, fountains, waterfalls, a wading pool, and jogging track.

An exciting addition to Kuala Lumpur’s culinary scene, the Hotel will introduce several unique dining outlets to the city, including a Cantonese restaurant, lobby and rooftop pool bars, and an all-day dining restaurant with sweeping views of the Petronas Twin Towers.

The Hotel will also offer an executive lounge for business travelers, a serene spa, wellness-focused fitness centre and rooftop infinity pool offering panoramic views of Kuala Lumpur’s endless skyline. Lush landscaping around the rooftop pool and terrace will create an urban oasis, echoing the greenery of the KLCC Park below.
